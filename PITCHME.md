### Delivering Programming Material Online

- Lectures
- Tutorials
- Tips

---

#### Identify Session Length

- Traditional 50 mins ->  15 mins + break + 15 mins
- Blended 50 mins -> 5-30 mins (pre-recorded) + 15 mins live

Note: 15 mins content time, not including intro / conclusion, etc.

---

#### Identify Theory-Practice Balance

- Theoretical material needs concrete examples (e.g. code, diagrams, etc.)
- Give a demo upfront
- Upload source code / lecture notes to GitHub / StudentCentral

---

#### Set up Hardware

- Limit internet usage during live session
- Check camera output
- Check mic output
- Avoid using laptop mic and use a separate headset (e.g. from a phone) if available
- Check settings, e.g. noise reduction, mic boost

---

#### Set up Software

Before session, open:

- Lecture slides
- Development Environment (IDE)
- (optional) Paint for hand-drawn sketches

---

#### Set up Screen Share

- Use larger font size
- Share entire desktop if need multiple windows

---

#### Check Your Pace

- Slow down if needed
- Can check time on desktop (bottom right on Windows 10)

---

#### Tutorials 

- Screen share on Teams
- Online collaboration tool: https://codecollab.io
- IDEs also have built-in plugins: VS code live share, atom teletype, etc.

- Project Overview
- Implementation Details
- Report on 2018-20 achievements

---

#### CLT Scholarship project

- WBL: employability through authentic practical experience.
- Gamification: game principles in non-game contexts.
- Codefest: implementation of GWBL 2018-20.

---

#### Project Aim

Codefest is a monthly software development event that brings together:

- students
- latest technologies in Computer Science
- industry experts

---

#### Implementation

- Teams
- Challenges
- Prizes

---

#### Teams

* Students from all courses are welcome.
* Industry experts are sometimes present to mentor students.

---

#### Challenges

Each challenge has two steps:

1. Given a solution, figure out the question.
2. Implement the solution.

---

#### Challenge Example (Simplified)

The format is: `(input) -> output`

- `(2) -> 4`
- `(3) -> 5`
- `(5) -> 7`

+++

We can derive the question: (x) + 2?


```
int func(int x) {
    return x + 2;
}
```
